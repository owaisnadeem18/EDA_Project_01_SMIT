> "In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 — uncovering insights from matches, players, and teams through data."

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup 2024.  
The primary goal of this project is to clean, process, and analyze cricket data to extract meaningful insights, uncover trends, and visualize patterns related to teams, players, and match performances.

Through this analysis, we aim to answer questions like:

- Which teams performed consistently throughout the tournament?
- Which players had the highest impact?
- What were the key factors influencing match outcomes?

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
